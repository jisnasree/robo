## What Can Robo Do? ##

* Move around
* show emotions 
* Talk 
* Tweet 
* Video Stream
* Respond to commands

## Technology Stack ##

The Heart of Robo is a Raspberry pi running raspbian. It has node.js installed. Motor and Sensor control is done by Arduino.

Raspberry Pi controls the Arduino using Johnny Five 

Robo sends the vital information to cloud storage powered by Firebase.

Robo responds to control signals from cloud storage (Firebase )



## Stack in Detail ##

### Hardware ###

Robo is powered by 4 geared motors ( 200rpm ) and is wired using HBridge driver for bi-directional functionality.
The whole system is driven by a 12v rechargable battery - mounted below the chasis.
The motor drivers are driven by Arduino which inturn is driven by Raspberry pi using Johnny five.

### Speech ###

The speech component is a node wrapper around the festival utility in linux. 

### Real Time Communication ###

Thanks to Firebase, real time communication has become so easy. The Robo's remote controller ( A web app ) and the on board computer ( Raspberry Pi ) communicates using the Firebase Storage as the common point.

### Showing emotions ###

The Face of the Robo is built using a simple phonegap App. Which subscribes to the cloud storage (Firebase ) events.

### Sensors ###

* Geo location - The phonegap application pushes the geolocation information back to cloud
* Accelerometer - The phonegap application pushes the accelerometer information back to cloud on a regular interval
* Light Sensor - Simple LDR module connected to Arduino. Pushes the room ambience
* Ultra Sound Sensors - Sensors attached to Arduino protects the Robo from reckless driving and collition. Robo autostops when it is harmful for him.
* PIR Sensor - Detects motion / human presence.
    PIR Sensor used has three pins. Vcc, Output and Gnd. The output is one bit and triggers on motion.
